Golden rush!
Game Rule

Hi adventurer! Welcome to the Golden Rush! World.

One day, you go to bed and sleep as a usual night. A few moments later, you realize that you get into the world of jewellery. It's full of Diamond, Gold, Silver, and Bronze on the floor! You must pick them up faster than the other adventurer! There are some points you should be aware of:

1. First, enter your username and choose the difficulty (easy/hard), your
   username is the name of your adventurer.

2. The initial location of the adventurers and jewellery are randomized
   Each adventurer can make one move round by round, one after another, by clicking the 'W,A,S,D' buttons on your keyboard to    go up, left, down, right respectively.

3. When you reach the location where the jewellery is located at, you get the
   points according to the type of jewellery.

  Diamond: 100 points
  Gold:    50 points
  Silver:  20 points
  Bronze:  10 points

4. Each round of the game is called a set. The game ends when there is no jewellery left on the map. The total score of each adventurer will be recorded for that round and accumulate with all the other sets. The first adventurer who scores higher in two sets wins the game.

5. We store the most recent ten records of the game to the scoreboard and save the top 3 adventurers who have got the highest score in history.

We hope you all can enjoy the game and grab your jewellery at ease!
