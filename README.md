## Description
We are planning to make a competitive hunting game. It can be 1 player vs. computer or PVP. The adventurers battle on a n x n square gameboard, Resources are generated randomly on it. Players can control their character and get the resources on the gameboard. Each type of resource (Diamond/Gold/Silver/Bronze) carries different points. The game ends once all resources have been collected. The player who gets the most points wins the set, the first player who gets two sets wins the game. Scores of winners will be permanently stored in a scoreboard table.
