Players can control their adeventurers and get the resources on the gameboard. Each type of resource (Diamond/Gold/Silver/Bronze) carries different points. The round ends once all the resources have been collected. The player who gets more points wins the round, the game will end once one of the player wins two games in total, and the winner will be the one who scores more in total(Note: winners are determined by their cumulated scores, you may still lose even if you have won two of the three rounds).
